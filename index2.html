  <ol> Follow this list to inspect the source of whatever browser you're using
    PS. This won't work with Safari. I reccomend Google Chrome or Firefox
    <li>Right click anywhere on the webpage</li>
    <li>Click where it says "Inspect Element" or "Inspect"</li>
    <li>Once you click that, a lot of things will pop up on your screen.
      If you select the "Element" tab, you can see all the code for whatever web
      page you're looking at! It's pretty cool.
    </li>
    <li>Look at the code and try and make sense of it! It's not as bad as you
      think.
    </li>
