      <p>Researchers at the University of Notre Dame are using AI to develop an early warning system that will identify manipulated images, fake news videos and disinformation online. <br> The project is an effort to combat the rise of coordinated social media campaigns to incite violence, sew discord and threaten the integrity of democratic elections.

        The system uses image retrieval and applies computer vision techniques to root out political memes from multiple social networks. They retrieved around two million images and content from various social media  related to the 2019 general election.</p>

      <li><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/cass/">CASS</a></li>
      <p>CASS, also known as Content-Aware Search System, is a project that investigates how to build an efficient similarity search engine for "feature-rich (non-text)" data.
         The research topics include sketch construction and indexing for similarity search. The current toolkit is used to construct search systems for data types including audio recordings, digital photos and 3D shapes </p>
