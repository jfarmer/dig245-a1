      <ol>
        <li><a href='https://iliads.org/'><strong>Institute for Liberal Arts Digital Scholarship (ILiADS):</strong></a>
          ILiADS is a weeklong summer institute focused on increasing student/faculty/staff collaborations in the publication of digital projects. Originally started as a collaboration among a few liberal arts institutions, ILiADS has grown to allow submissions from outside the liberal arts world and has flourished into a supportive network and community set on bringing credibility to digital works in academia.<br></li>

        <li value="2"><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_in_the_Key_of_Life'><strong><em>Songs in the Key of Life (1976)</em> by Stevie Wonder:</strong></a>
          <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> is Stevie Wonder's eighteenth studio album is one of my all time favorites. Growing up with a dad that alternated between Motown, eighties pop-rock, and reggae on a daily basis has given me an eclectic music taste to say the least. This album, though, seems to encompass not only what Wonder must've been feeling when recording the album from 1974 to 1976, but the highs and lows of the human experience in general. From being able to recite every lyric and background vocal in "As" to knowing the horn melody by heart on "Sir Duke" or empathizing with the singer on "Joy Inside My Tears," this album is nothing short of legendary in my book.</li>

        <li><a href='http://thisistheread.com/'><strong>The Read (podcast):</strong></a>
          <em>The Read</em> is a podcast hosted by Kid Fury and Crissle West on black popular culture trending around the world. Introduced to me by a friend of mine last year, this podcast, published weekly, is a genuine highlight of my routine and can have me laughing, screaming, and crying in a single episode. Filled with hot takes and advice on letters sent in from listeners, Fury and West have become iconic in their delivery of blunt yet thoughtful ideas. In October 2019, the pair launched a television version of their show on Fuse.</li>
