  <h1> Hello, my name is Christos and this is me : </h1>

<h1> About me: </h1>
<h2>I am a freshman at Davidson College </h2>
<h2> The reason I am taking this course is because I want to become an entrepreneur, but I lack the technical skills required.
  Therefore I am in this program in order to diversify and improve my technical skills</h2>
  <h3> <small>Secret Time: At the start of the program I was afraid and anxious, as I had no past experience with coding,
     and I was really worried that I would just consider coding boring. However, I am very happy, since, now,  I think that coding is amazing. </small></h3>
  <h1> My goals for this program</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Familiarize myself with coding </li>
    <li>Learning how to be able to learn and use programming languages on my own</li>
    <li>Improve my networking skills</li>
    <li>Increase my connections</li>
  </ul>

<h1> Here are 3 projects I am intrested in completing</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Build my own calculator. The reason I want to do this, is because it is a relatively simple task that allows me to
    create a product, nonetheless, and something I can show my parents.</li>
  <li>Build my own chess game. The reason I want to do this one, is because I consider chess a complex game, and therefore,
    I expect that coding it will be very challenging, fun and rewarding.</li>
  <li>Build my own functioning to do list app. The reason I want to do this is because I've been wanting to create such an app, as the current apps
    do not work like I want them to, and then use it as a basis to start exploring designing more in depth.

  </li>

</ul>
  <h1></h1>Here is some code I wrote
  <pre>
    <code>
      function preferenceEyecolor(eyecolor){
        for (let i = 0; i < eyecolor.length; i += 1) {
          console.log(`[${i + 1}] ${eyecolor[i]}`);
        }
        let choice = readlineSync.question('What color eyes do you dream your soulmate to have?');
        console.log();
     return eyecolor[choice -1];
      }
      </code>
