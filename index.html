  <h1><strong>Course Interest</strong></h1>
  <p>I always was interested in website design because it provides me the option to create interactive
    websites that I could use in the future. Whether I wanted to create a website
    for my future business or for a company I work at. Developing these skills allows
    me to have more creative control over what I want people to see.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>Programming Experience</strong></h2>
  <p>This course is my first experience with dealing with html and Css. I have done things
    where I work on a blog post or use davidson domains to strucutre websites using an
    external web application. However, I never understood the basics of web applications that
    were altering the html for me. In terms of programming, I have been able to learn
    python and java while at Davidson College. I worked on several interesting projects
    where I would take tweets about a certain company and rank how favorable they were based on
    the language used. Also, I created several games like Boggle and Connect 4.
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3>
  <p>My goals for this course is to get comfortable with connecting html with javascript, so that I can create
    interactive code that can write or alter html by itself. Also, with all the Coronavirus stuff going
    on, I want to create my own website where I post reliable and relevant content about
    the virus.
  </p>
  <h4><strong> Project Interests</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A topic I am interested is, <a href= "https://www.pubnub.com/blog/javascript-mapping-javascript-tracking/">Geolocation</a>
    It teaches how to retrieve, publish, and display live-updating geolocation data on a realtime map using JavaScript and Google Maps API.
    I think it is very interesting because many apps use similar elements
    and it can be helpful if I want to use that information in the future. Also,
    it is something that the US government is using in regards to trying to locate and follow the spread
    of the Coronavirus.</li>
    <li>Another project that could be useful in the future is,<a href= "https://codepen.io/aomyers/pen/LWOwpR">interactive Map</a>
    I found it very interesting because it constructred buildings and 3d models of surrounding areas using jquery and built in databases. I think it would be cool
    to be able to use these maps for other projects in unison with the geolocation project above. </li>
    <li> My last project that I would like to do is, <a href= "https://codepen.io/i0z/pen/mFLCw">Flying Game</a>
    I do not think it is the most complicated thing to do in the world. However, I like that it combines graphics(html/css) with
    game logic of javascript. It is similar to Galliga and it records highscores and takes user input with keyboards.
    I am interested in gaming and I think it could be a good first step to understanding and learning
    more about the innerworkings of simple games.  </li>

  </ul>
