      <h1>Hi, I'm Rachel!<img src="images/portrait.jpg"></h1>
      <p>
        <br/>
        I'm a sophomore math major at Davidson college, and I'm also minoring in gender & sexuality studies!
        I'm taking <code>DIG245</code> because I know that knowledge of critical web design will be a strength in any career. Whether I go into
        the tech industry, humanities, education, or business, knowing how to build a website will be an essential skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until I took this class, I had never made content for the web. While I started coding in high school
         with <code>Python</code> and <code>Java</code>, this class has been my first venture into coding with <code>JavaScript, HTML,</code> and <code>CSS</code>. My goals
        in this class are to become comfortable with CSS and HTML, to learn how to present my job experience and education on my own website, and to build several projects that I can reference to show understanding of
        different technical skills.
      </p>

        <a href="https://www.ocearch.org/tracker/?list" target="_blank">Ocearch</a> is an organization that collects data on ocean life. You can use their site to track all kinds of ocean creatures.
        Here's a summary of their work: <blockquote> OCEARCH is a data-centric organization built to help scientists collect previously unattainable
        data in the ocean. Our mission is to accelerate the ocean's return to abundance through fearless innovations in scientific research, education, outreach and policy.
        </blockquote> <br>
        I'm interested in this project because data science is a field that I have recently started to explore.
        This summer I hope to do research at my school on conservation ecology.

      <p> <a href="https://hillergoodspeed.com/" target="_blank">This</a> is the website of Hiller Goodspeed, an artist. He uses a lot of different mediums, and his website is simple, cheerful, and authentic to his art style. I am personally a big fan of his creations and especially his drawings,
          which are sometimes strange but always relatable. Here's a short bio: <blockquote> "Hiller Goodspeed lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. He enjoys swimming in the ocean, being in the woods, and "just sort of lying around".

        <p> <a href="https://www.brrch.com/" target="_blank">BRRCH</a> is a design studio run by Brittany Asch. Her medium of choice is flowers.
        These arrangements create a magical world with simple elements of nature. I admire her mission, which Asch describes as: <blockquote> Delivering flowers as art to heighten
          the appreciation of the natural world around us. With a deep respect for natural landscapes, Brittany aims to create floral climates from worlds that do not exist.
