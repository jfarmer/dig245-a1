  <div class="desc"> <strong>Sonic Mania</strong> was originally a fan made project
    to pay hommage to the classic platformer, but SEGA liked their project
    so much that they decided to work along with the fans making the game.
    I've grown up loving sonic and now that I'm learning code I know some of what
    it takes to make this game and it is so well done you'd be surpised that
    it's fan made.

  <div class="desc"> Often times, when classics are remade or rebooted
    there are a lot of things that go wrong and leave long running fans upset.
    Recently Capcom has been remaking some of their classics, but they've done it right.
    Last year they remade <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> and are set to release the <strong>RE: 3 remake</strong> in April.
    They didn't change up the core of what made the game great in the first place, but
    instead did a great job of implementing new technology to create a solid remake.
    It's perfect for old resident evil fans to walk down memory lane while
    beginning a completely new and terrifying journey. I'd even reccomend it
    to someone who's never played any of the games.

  <div class="desc">Toyota has made a robot named <strong>Cue 3</strong> that can shoot 3 pointers better than Steph Curry?!
    Whether or not that's true, it is true that the robot can shoot threes.
    I found this interesting because it's another example of something being done
    through the power of code that was once only a fantasy. It's also kinda scary.
