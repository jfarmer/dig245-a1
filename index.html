    <h2>Purpose with this course</h2>
    <p>
      I am in this course, and the Adjacent program in general, in effort to gain the technical skills necessary
      to make myself an attractive hire for positions in business analytics, consulting, and data science, potentially
      in the "tech industry".

    <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Prior to this course, I considered myself very new to the sphere of creating web content, and also to programming.
      I feel that I have been learning pretty quickly, and it has been a very engaging experience.  The project-based aspect of the
      program does a great job of inspiring the curiosity that motivates me to work hard.

          The Golden State Warriors have partnered with sponsor Zoom to provide "4DReplay" tech in the new Chase Center, using an array of cameras at various levels.
          Using this tech, referees and broadcast technicians can reproduce an incredible variety of angles in replay.  This could potentially be a vast change to the fan
          experience, as well, because there is talk of a mobile app to use this feature in the future.

        <p>
          I have personally used this Glide app to create a couple of potentially useful apps for my daily life, such as a meal plan tracker
          and an app for roommates living together in an apartment.  This app brings users with a basic knowledge of spreadsheets the ability to put
          that data and functionality on their smartphones in a simple, functional, and visually appealing way.  It does not involve any code for users,
          and automatically syncs with a selected workbook in their linked Google Drive account.

        <p>
          I found this coding competition website online when searching for projects and programs that
          encourage kids of all ages to pursue learning and improving programming skills. What I find really interesting about this
          particular site is its competitive aspect - without having signed up to see what it's like on the inside, it looks like students
          can participate in high score-based competitions with others, and also join "clans" which compete against other clans.  I like this idea,
          because I do believe that competition is one of the best drivers of self-improvement.
