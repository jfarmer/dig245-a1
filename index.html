    This page will answer <i>several</i> questions asked. <b>Here are the questions:</b>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Why are you taking this course?</li>
    <li>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</li>
    <li>What are your goals in this course?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    I will also share 3 projects I have found really interesting with the world!
  </p>
  <h3>
    The Answers:
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>I'm taking this course because I want to see what coding looks and feels like on the internet. We interact with code everyday without realizing it, and I want to learn how everything works.</li>
    <li>Before this semester, I have had almost no exposure to coding for the web. I sat it on a club meeting in my sophomore year and created the basic structure of a webpage, but I hadn't done anything since.</li>
    <li>In this class, I hope to develop and design my own webpage without the help and designs of other sources.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    And here are the 3 projects. I decided to focus on a "game mod" theme, inspired by the novel we are reading for English, Warcross.
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/mod-chest"><b>Minecraft in a Chest</b></a></li>
      <img alt="Chest" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-j2wupurm4s/maxresdefault.jpg" width="300" height="175"/>
      <p>I find this mod super interesting because it seems so basic and simple yet has so much logic going on in the backend. It allows users to interact with the generated Minecraft world without actually leaving the structure they are in!</p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://pmunofficial.com/en/">Project M</a></li>
      <img alt="Chest" src="https://www.popsci.com/resizer/33oWBKuSzENQ-ktYLV8O2eM9J5I=/760x428/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bonnier.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HGK6K6PZOZN6MIWMG3MKEJTLEY.png" width="300" height="175"/>
      <p>Project M started in response to the gaming community's negative reception to Super Smash Bros Brawl. Of all the titles in the series, Brawl had the least balance among characters in its roster, allowing for a few broken characters to dominate tier lists. Project M takes the basic structure of Brawl and adds its own spin that balances out characters, as well as adds their own items and versions of characters (such as Toad from the Mario franchise).</p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://gmod.facepunch.com/">Garry's Mod</a></li>
      <img alt="Chest" src="https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/PCGN-Garry's-Mod-4-1200x675.jpg" width="300" height="175"/>
      <p>Garry's Mod is the most widely known game mod (at least among PC and Steam users). The game is essentially a massive mod of Valve's game engine. Though it plays like an open-world sandbox title, people have figured out how to use it for animation and other uses!</p>
