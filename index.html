    Experience
  </h2>
  <p>
    - I have no prior experience with web development, but I did take a programming course last semester at Davidson.
    That course prepared me best for the programming I additionally learned here. Without it, I would have been completely lost.

      <h3> Poolside FM</h3>
      Need that perfect summer playlist? In the car, on the beach, cleaning your house, this is the perfect summer vibe. I always wondered how songs can automatically play when you visit a page, but now I know it's because of HTML!
      This page inspires anyone who loves music and simplicity. The page offers simple access to all its links with a simple layout. Sometimes things are best understood at their simplest value, and this is a straightforward project with a solid purpose.

      <h3>Alicen Lewis' personal blog</h3>
      Alicen visited Adjacent earlier in the semester to teach us about self branding. Ever since her visit, I've been secure on fitting into my personal brand.
      It will push you further within your specific role if you know how to brand yourself. Additionally, it motivated me to continue working on my brand through my own personal website. She shared hers with us, and that's why I shared it here.
      I can better design my personal website through my new knowledge and learning of HTML, and I'm excited to have this collection of knowledge meet one another.

      <h3>Equal Justice Initiative</h3>
      EJI is a non-profit that helps unjustly incarcerated people off death row in Alabama. Bryan Stevenson is one of the co-founders, and I met him last June. I have a lot of faith and passion in EJI's mission and values.
      Additionally, their website captures the eye best through large pictures that easily transfer you to another page to read further about the idea. The user can easily visually understand what they are looking at and following.
      A website I created during my internship last summer for an EJI project in Mecklenburg County was based off similar ideas to largely use photos to capture the user. Visuals are a large part of the musuem and website.
